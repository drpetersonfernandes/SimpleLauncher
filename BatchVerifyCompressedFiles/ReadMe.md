## Features

- **Multiple Archive Formats**: Verify ZIP, 7Z, and RAR files
- **Batch Processing**: Verify multiple files in a single operation
- **Subdirectory Support**: Option to include subdirectories in the verification process
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging of the verification process
- **File Information Display**: View detailed information about each compressed file
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar and status updates
- **Statistics**: Track verification success and failure rates
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean Windows application interface

## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- .NET 9.0 or later
- 7z.exe and 7z_x86.exe (included with the application)
   - The application automatically selects the appropriate executable based on your system architecture

## Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice
3. Run `BatchVerifyCompressedFiles.exe`

*No installation required - the application is portable.*

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Run `BatchVerifyCompressedFiles.exe`
2. **Select Input Folder**: Click the "Browse" button to select the folder containing your compressed files
3. **Configure Options**:
   - Select which file types to verify (ZIP, 7Z, RAR)
   - Check "Include subfolders" if you want to process files in all subdirectories
4. **Start Verification**: Click the "Start Verification" button to begin the process
5. **View Results**:
   - The verification log displays the progress and status of each file
   - The file information panel shows details about the currently processing compressed file
   - Statistics at the bottom track overall verification results

## Verification Process

The application uses 7-Zip to perform the following checks on each compressed file:

- Archive header structure verification
- File contents integrity testing
- CRC/checksum validation
- Extraction simulation (without writing files)

A compressed file passes verification only if all checks are successful.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **"7z.exe not found" or "7z_x86.exe not found"**: Ensure that both 7z.exe (for 64-bit systems) and 7z_x86.exe (for 32-bit systems) are in the same directory as the application
- **Verification failures**: Corrupted archives will fail verification - they should be replaced or repaired
- **Application crashes**: The application includes automatic error reporting - please allow any error reports to be sent to help improve the software

### Logs

The verification log window displays all operations and can help diagnose issues. If you need assistance, you can copy the log content for support purposes.

## About Compressed File Formats

- **ZIP**: A widely used archive format that provides lossless data compression. Most operating systems have built-in support for ZIP files.
- **7Z**: A compressed archive format that supports high compression ratios and strong AES-256 encryption.
- **RAR**: A proprietary archive file format that supports data compression, error recovery, and file spanning.
