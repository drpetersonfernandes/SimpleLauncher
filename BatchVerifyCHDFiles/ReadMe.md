## Features

- **Batch Processing**: Verify multiple CHD files in a single operation
- **Subdirectory Support**: Option to include subdirectories in the verification process
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging of the verification process
- **File Information Display**: View detailed information about each CHD file
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar and status updates
- **Statistics**: Track verification success and failure rates
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean Windows application interface

## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- .NET 9.0 or later
- CHDMAN.exe (included with the application)

## Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. Extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice
3. Run `BatchVerifyCHDFiles.exe`

*No installation required - the application is portable.*

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Run `BatchVerifyCHDFiles.exe`
2. **Select Input Folder**: Click the "Browse" button to select the folder containing your CHD files
3. **Configure Options**: 
   - Check "Include subfolders" if you want to process CHD files in all subdirectories
4. **Start Verification**: Click the "Start Verification" button to begin the process
5. **View Results**: 
   - The verification log displays the progress and status of each file
   - The file information panel shows details about the currently processing CHD file
   - Statistics at the bottom track overall verification results

## Verification Process

The application uses CHDMAN (from the MAME project) to perform the following checks on each CHD file:

- CHD header structure verification
- Internal metadata validation
- Data integrity checking against checksums
- Decompression testing of data hunks

A CHD file passes verification only if all checks are successful.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **"chdman.exe not found"**: Ensure that chdman.exe is in the same directory as the application
- **Verification failures**: Corrupted CHD files will fail verification - they should be replaced or repaired
- **Application crashes**: The application includes automatic error reporting - please allow any error reports to be sent to help improve the software

### Logs

The verification log window displays all operations and can help diagnose issues. If you need assistance, you can copy the log content for support purposes.

## About CHD Files

CHD (Compressed Hunks of Data) is a compressed file format commonly used for storing disk, CD, and DVD images, primarily in emulation contexts. The format was developed by the MAME team to efficiently store large ROM images.
