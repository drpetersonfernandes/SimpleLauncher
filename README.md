## Installation

Download the application from the [release page](https://github.com/drpetersonfernandes/SimpleLauncher/releases).  
Extract the ZIP file into a writable folder. We do not recommend using a network folder or installing it inside `C:\Program Files`.  
If necessary, you may need to grant "Simple Launcher" administrative access. The application requires write access to its own folder.

## Basic Usage

- Click the **Edit System** menu item.
- Click the **Easy Mode** menu item.
- Follow the steps to install a system.
- Add ROM files for that system in the designated folder.
- Add cover images for that system in the designated folder.
- Return to the Main Window.
- Select the added system from the dropdown menu.
- Click the **All** button to display all games for that system.
- Click the game you wish to launch.

## Where to Find ROMs or ISOs

We do **NOT** provide ROMs or ISOs.

## Where to Find Game Cover Images

We provide an image pack for some systems.  
If the image pack is not available, you can download cover images from websites like [Libretro Thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails) or [EmuMovies](https://emumovies.com).

## Advanced Usage

Simple Launcher also offers Expert Mode for advanced users.  
In this mode, you can manually add, edit, or delete systems in the frontend.  
Users can customize folders, add multiple emulators for the same system, and specify custom parameters.  
For more details, refer to our [Wiki](https://github.com/drpetersonfernandes/SimpleLauncher/wiki).

## Related Utilities

- **[MAME Utility](https://github.com/drpetersonfernandes/MAMEUtility):** A tool for managing full MAME driver information in XML format available on the [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org/release.html) website. It can generate multiple simplified (and smaller) XML subsets and copy ROMs and image files based on the generated XML.
- **[FindRomCover](https://github.com/drpetersonfernandes/FindRomCover):** An application that helps organize your cover image collection. It attempts to match image filenames with ROM filenames, and users can choose from different similarity algorithms.

## Technical Details

Simple Launcher is developed in C# using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Microsoft .NET Core 9 Framework.  
This program is Windows-only and has been tested on Windows 11.
