## Installation

Download the application from the [release page](https://github.com/drpetersonfernandes/SimpleLauncher/releases).<br>
Extract the ZIP file into a **writable folder**. We do not recommend using a network folder or installing it inside `C:\Program Files`.<br>
If necessary, you may need to grant "Simple Launcher" administrative access. The application requires write access to its own folder.<br>
For full functionality, especially on-the-fly file mounting, you must install **Dokan** from [GitHub](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/releases).

## Basic Usage

- Click the **Easy Mode** menu item.
- Follow the steps to install a system.
- Add ROM files for that system in the designated folder(s).
- Add cover images for that system in the designated folder.
- Return to the Main Window.
- If no system is selected, a visual **System Selection Screen** will help you choose your gaming platform. Otherwise, select the added system from the dropdown menu.
- Click the **All** button (or a letter/number filter) to display games for that system.
- Click the game you wish to launch.

## Key Features

## Where to Find ROMs or ISOs

We do **NOT** provide ROMs or ISOs.

If you are looking for MAME Sets, look it up on the [PleasureDome](https://pleasuredome.github.io/pleasuredome/index.html) website. I am not affiliated with PleasureDome in any way.

## Where to Find Game Cover Images

Image packs for some systems can be downloaded via **Edit System -> Download Image Pack**.<br>
If an image pack is not available, or for more comprehensive collections, you can download cover images from websites like [Libretro Thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails) or [EmuMovies](https://emumovies.com). I am not affiliated with these websites in any way.
