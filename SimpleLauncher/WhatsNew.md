### Core Feature Enhancements: On-the-Fly File Mounting
The most significant change is the introduction of on-the-fly file mounting, which allows users to launch games directly from compressed or disk image files without needing to manually extract them first.
**Note:** You need to install the Dokan from [GitHub](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany) for ZIP and XISO file mounting.

*   **ISO & ZIP Mounting for RPCS3:** The launcher can now mount `.iso` and `.zip` files for the PlayStation 3 emulator (RPCS3). It uses PowerShell for native ISO mounting and a new `SimpleZipDrive.exe` tool for ZIP files. After mounting, it automatically finds and launches the required `EBOOT.BIN` file.
*   **XISO Mounting for Cxbx-Reloaded:** Support has been added to mount Xbox ISO (`.xiso`) files for the Cxbx-Reloaded emulator. This is handled by a new `MountXisoFiles` service that uses the `xbox-iso-vfs.exe` tool to create a virtual drive and launch the `default.xbe` file.
*   **XBLA ZIP Mounting:** The system can now mount `.zip` files for Xbox Live Arcade (XBLA) games, searching for a specific nested file structure required to launch them.
*   **ScummVM ZIP Mounting:** The system can now mount `.zip` files for ScummVM games and automatically launch the game.

### Major Refactoring & Dependency Changes
The project's core dependencies and internal logic for handling files have been substantially overhauled to improve robustness and unify functionality.

*   **Unified Archive Handling:** The application has migrated away from using multiple libraries and external executables for file extraction. It now primarily uses `Squid-Box.SevenZipSharp` and `ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib`, providing a more integrated and reliable way to handle `.zip`, `.7z`, and `.rar` files. The `ExtractCompressedFile` service was refactored to use these new libraries.
*   **Removal of Caching System:** The `CacheManager` has been completely removed. The previous system of caching game lists for each system has been replaced with a more direct, on-demand file scanning approach. This simplifies the application's logic, eliminates the `cache` directory, and ensures the game list is always up to date.

### Update Tools
*   **BatchConvertToCHD:** Improved UI. Added the ability to check the integrity of CHD files and convert CSO files to CHD.
*   **BatchConvertToCompressedFile:** Improved UI. Added the ability to verify the integrity of compressed files.
*   **BatchConvertIsoToXiso:** Improved UI. Added the ability to verify the integrity of XISO files.
*   **BatchConvertToRvz:** Improved UI. Added the ability to test the integrity of the RVZ files.

### Bug Fixes and Other Enhancements
*   **Fixed Threading Issue:** The `PlayTimeWindow` and `FavoritesWindow` have been refactored to handle file operations and UI updates more safely across different threads, preventing crashes and ensuring a smoother user experience.
*   **UI Consistency:** The system selection screen now limits the maximum size of system thumbnails to 100 px to prevent oversized images from distorting the layout and to ensure a consistent look.

# Release 4.1.0
*06/08/25*
---
*   Added a Sound Configuration feature allowing customizable notification sounds.
*   Implement a Debug Logger with a dedicated UI window for enhanced logging.
*   Major overhaul and standardization of path resolution and handling, including support for placeholders `%BASEFOLDER%`, `%SYSTEMFOLDER%` and `%EMULATORFOLDER%`.
*   Refactored Parameter Validation logic for clarity and robustness, particularly concerning paths.
*   Improved Error Handling, Logging, and messaging across various components (`GameLauncher`, `Services`, `Managers`), replacing `Debug.WriteLine` with the new `DebugLogger`.
*   Added Status Bar updates to show current actions (e.g., game launched).
*   Introduced 3D button styles for navigation buttons.
*   Updated Tray Icon messaging and functionality (including Debug Window access).
*   Refactored Edit System Window logic and validation for better user feedback on paths.

# Release 4.0.1
*05/26/25*

### Bug Fix Version
-   **Parameter Handling Overhaul (`ParameterValidator.cs`, `GameLauncher.cs`):** Paths within parameters are converted to absolute paths.
-   **File Path Standardization (`GameLauncher.cs`, `GameButtonFactory.cs`, `GameListFactory.cs`):** File paths used for launching games and creating UI elements are consistently resolved to absolute paths relative to the application directory, improving reliability.
-   **UI Enhancements (`MainWindow.xaml`):** A new custom-styled `GridSplitter` has been added to the list view in the main window, allowing for better resizing of the game list and preview areas.
-   **Improved Window Closing (`DownloadImagePackWindow.xaml.cs`, `EasyModeWindow.xaml.cs`):** Added logic to the `CloseWindowRoutine` in `DownloadImagePackWindow` and `EasyModeWindow` to stop any ongoing operations (like downloads) before the window closes, preventing potential errors.
-   **Configuration Change (`SystemManager.cs`):** The default value for `ReceiveANotificationOnEmulatorError` in system configurations has been changed from `false` to `true`, meaning users will now receive error notifications by default.
