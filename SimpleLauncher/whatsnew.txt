release3.6.0
------------

11/23/2024
- I performed a major refactoring of the `EditSystem` class to implement better validation in the input fields of the `EditSystem` window. This was necessary to prevent users from entering incorrect values.
- I improved the system validation mechanism of the `system.xml` file when 'Simple Launcher' loads. Instead of warning the user about a corrupted file and shutting down the application, it will now remove any corrupted systems, alert the user, and preserve the well-formatted systems. This is useful in the case of a corrupted `system.xml` file.
- I implemented in-memory download and extraction of files as a backup method in case the regular extraction method fails. This was done because some users were encountering extraction errors of newly downloaded files due to file locks.
- Added different versions of the `7z` executable for x86 and x64. The extraction method will automatically detect the user environment and use the appropriate executable.

-------------

10/27/2024
- I have improved the field validation in the "Edit System" window to trim input values and prevent the input of empty spaces.
- I have enhanced support for Xbox 360 XBLA games in the Launcher. The frontend will extract the compressed file inside the temp folder, then look inside each extracted folder to find a folder named 000D0000. From within that folder, it will select the first found file and try to launch it with the Xenia emulator. For this to work, the 'System Name' needs to include 'XBLA' in it. Also, the system must be configured to extract the file before launch.
- I have fixed the download of the 'ares' emulator. This emulator is the default in the 'Easy Mode' window for Nintendo Satellaview and Sega Genesis CD.
- I have fixed the download of the 'Redream' emulator. This emulator is the default in the 'Easy Mode' window for Sega Dreamcast.
- I have fixed a bug in the 'Easy Mode' window to prevent the extraction of partially downloaded files.

- Enabled download of ImagePack for some systems. More will come in the future. Currently available for Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 7800, Atari Jaguar, Atari Jaguar CD, Bandai WonderSwan, Bandai WonderSwan Color, Casio PV1000, NEC PCEngine, NEC SuperGrafx, Sega Dreamcast, Sega GameGear, Sega Genesis, Sega Genesis 32x, Sega Genesis CD, Sega Master System, Sega SC3000, Sega SG1000, SNK NeoGeo Pocket, and SNK NeoGeo Pocket Color.

Fixed all bugs found.
I have tested the application for the last two days and have not found any bugs. However, please be aware that there may still be bugs due to the many new functionalities introduced. If you find any bugs, please report them here on GitHub or use the Bug Report Window inside 'Simple Launcher.' Any reported bugs will be fixed promptly.

release2.13.0
-------------

05/17/2024
I have implemented an experimental algorithm to check the emulator parameters. It will check the folder location and file location and allow relative paths.
I have also improved the extraction method that extracts files to a temporary folder in case the system extracts any files.
Additionally, I have made minor bug fixes.

release2.12.1
-------------

03/31/2024
I've improved the error notification system.
Also fixed a bug with the emulator location check. Thanks to bigroy00 for identifying the bug.

release2.12.0
-------------

03/25/2024
I have implemented basic checks for the System Folder, System Image Folder, and Emulator Location. The app will notify the user if the values in these fields are incorrect. Users can use both absolute and relative paths for any of these fields.
I have also made the exception notifications more user-friendly.
Additionally, I've devised a smart method for generating the system.xml file. If the system.xml file is present, the app will use it. If not, the app will search for any backup files in the folder and ask the user if they want to restore from that backup. In case no backup is found, the app will create a basic system.xml. This approach prevents users from inadvertently overwriting their custom system.xml and losing their personal configuration.

release2.11.2.23
----------------

03/20/2024
I've fixed a bug in the 'Show Games' option. Now it's working properly.

Additionally, I've updated the mame.xml to the latest version.
I've also improved the launch error message. Now, users can see details about the error.

Before updating, please remember to back up your existing system.xml, or it will be overwritten by the default system.xml included in the zip file.

release2.10.0.10
----------------

03/12/2024
Fixed the vertical scroll. Now, it will reset to the top position when a user selects a different button.
The app now retains the window size and state between instances. These values are now saved in settings.xml and loaded back when the user starts the program.
Users can now use a default.png file from the System Image Folder. If it is not found in that folder, the app will load the default image from the default location, which is inside the image folder of the application folder.
Users can now see all the parameters associated with the system in the main UI. It is now easy and fast to check if your configuration is correct. If not, you can use the Edit System menu to fix it.
I have added a numeric value for pagination. Now, users know which files they are viewing on each page.
Fixed some bugs.

release2.9.0.90
---------------

03/10/2024
I've added the option to display all games for the selected system.
I've implemented pagination in the main UI, allowing users to select the number of games to be displayed on each page. This was necessary to prevent loading a huge number of games at once, which could consume a lot of memory and lead to application or system crashes.
Additionally, I've added an option to edit the Video Link and Info Link, where users can enter their favorite search engine.
Also, I've added an option to back up the system.xml from within the Edit System Window, useful for preventing loss of your custom configuration.

Additionally, I have optimized the current code.
